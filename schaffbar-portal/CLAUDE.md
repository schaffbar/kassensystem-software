## Helper functions vs. private methods

- **Pure functions** (no `this`, no signals, no injected services – the result depends only on the parameters) are
  module-level functions, **not exported**, and placed **after the class**.
  Examples: `toModel(tool)`, `relevantValues(model)` in `tool-wlan-relais.component.ts`,
  `toErrorMessage(error)` in `field-error.component.ts`.
- **Everything that needs `this`** (component state, signals, forms, services) is a `private` method in the
  `// helper` section at the end of the class.

Why: an unexported function is private to the file (stronger than TypeScript's `private`), shows at a glance that it
has no state, and can be used anywhere without caring about `this`. The class itself only contains what belongs to the
component (inputs, outputs, signals, handlers).
